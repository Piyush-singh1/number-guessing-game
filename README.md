# number-guessing-game
A fun and interactive Python-based number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides helpful hints ("Too high" or "Too low") and keeps track of the number of attempts. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
